# Web-Scraping-Challenge: Mission to Mars!! 👩🏻‍🚀

For this mission, (if we chose to accept it!) we were exploring Mars through the internet. By scraping 3 different websites and using our powers of BeautifulSoup and Flask we were able to prepare ourselves for a little trip to the Red Planet!

First, we checked out the latest headlines for Mars by visiting https://spaceimages-mars.com/. Using our code we are able to pull the daily headlines and description paragraph. Today Sherlock and Watson go to space! You can read about it in the attached pic and if you would like to know more feel free to look up the app.py directly as it is updated multiple times per day!

Once we had read the news, we took a look at the latest Mars art and learned a few facts that everyone should know using https://spaceimages-mars.com and https://galaxyfacts-mars.com!

Finally, we received a geology lesson from https://marshemispheres.com/ and got some spectacular views of all the hemispheres of Mars! Now that I am ready to leave for my trip to Mars I think I need to take a short nap first! All of this exploration has me exhausted! Take a look at all that I learned today while I take a little rest!
